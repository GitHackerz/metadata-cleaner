# Metadata Cleaner

A cross-platform desktop application built with Rust and Iced that scans directories for files containing metadata (EXIF, XMP, IPTC, GPS, etc.) and strips that metadata using ExifTool — protecting your privacy before you share files.

## Features

- **Directory Scanning** — Recursively scan folders; progress updates in real time
- **Drag-and-Drop** — Drop a folder directly onto the window to start scanning
- **Folder Picker** — Click *Select Folder* to browse for a directory
- **Metadata Cleaning** — Removes all metadata tags via ExifTool; runs in background
- **Backup Before Clean** — Optionally keep `.original` copies of files before stripping
- **Cancellable Scans** — Abort an in-progress scan at any time
- **Scan Persistence** — Every scan is saved to a local SQLite database
- **History Page** — Browse all past scans; load any previous scan's file list
- **Export Reports** — Save scan results to JSON or CSV with timestamped filenames
- **Dark / Light Theme** — Toggle via the Settings panel; preference is persisted
- **Wide Format Support** — JPG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, GIF, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, MP3, WAV, FLAC, MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV

## Prerequisites

**ExifTool must be installed and on your system `PATH`.**

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `brew install exiftool` |
| Ubuntu / Debian | `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl` |
| Fedora / RHEL | `sudo dnf install perl-Image-ExifTool` |
| Windows | Download from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/), rename to `exiftool.exe`, add to `PATH` |

If ExifTool is not found, the app starts normally but the *Clean Metadata* button is disabled and a warning banner is shown.

## Building & Running

You need the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (stable, 1.75+).

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/metadata-cleaner.git
cd metadata-cleaner

# Development build
cargo run

# Optimised release build
cargo run --release
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

Tests cover: domain model serialization, SQLite CRUD operations, scanner extension filtering, and JSON/CSV export correctness.

## Usage

1. **Open** — Launch the app. The Scanner page opens with a prompt.
2. **Select** — Drag a folder onto the window, or click **Select Folder**.
3. **Scan** — The app walks the directory tree and lists all supported files.
4. **Review** — Inspect file paths, types, and current statuses in the list.
5. **Clean** — Click **Clean Metadata**. Each file is processed in the background; the list updates as files are cleaned.
6. **Export** — Click **Export Report** to save a JSON or CSV report.
7. **History** — Switch to the **History** tab to see all previous scans and load their file lists.

```

**Communication pattern**: All backend calls are made directly from Iced's `update()` method (single-threaded event loop). Heavy work (ExifTool subprocess calls, directory walks) runs in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. Results are streamed back to the UI via `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels, polled at 16ms intervals.

| `walkdir` | Directory traversal |
| `rfd` | Native async file dialogs |
| `serde` + `serde_json` + `csv` | Serialisation and export |
| `chrono` | Timestamps |
| `uuid` | Unique record IDs |
| `thiserror` | Structured error types |
| `log` + `env_logger` | Logging |
